//! A general class specifying an action to be performed by the Flash player
/*!
Buttons and DoAction tags utilize FActionRecords. 
When encountered in a button tag, the Flash player adds action to a list to be processed when a button state has changed.
When encountered in a DoAction tag, the Flash player adds the action to a list to be processed when a FCTShowframe tag is encountered. 
FActionRecords specifiy actions such as: starting and stoping movie play, toggling display quality, performing stack arithmetic... etc. 
Many actions involve the use of a last-on/first-off stack machine (Flash 4.0) that stores string values.
